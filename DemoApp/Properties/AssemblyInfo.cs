// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Major Version
//      Minor Version 
//      Build Number
//      Revision
//
// You can specify all the values or you can default the Revision and Build Numbers 
// by using the '*' as shown below:
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")]
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")]
//This attribute applies a version to the assembly.

//[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.*")]
//The * character is used to auto-increment a portion of the version automatically every time you compile (often used for the “build” number)
